  <meta name="description" content="Not at least due to the Covid period, the desire to emigrate has become more central to the thoughts of many Germans. Many things can be found: a job abroad, health care, security, etc. 
But often the dream is shifted towards retirement because children abroad cannot be educated, or only with compromises. There are 140 German schools abroad - but do I want or can I adjust my place in the world after school? Often not - and the dream bursts.

We would now like to offer these parents an alternative:

The Wilhelm von Humboldt Fernschule offers consistent instruction in the German language according to the German curriculum worldwide.  As a purely online school, we teach the lessons in small classes of 7-13 students in a virtual classroom with video chat. Our teachers also teach at German schools and have in-depth knowledge of the German school system. The students stay on the level of their age and can be seamlessly reintegrated into a German school without repetition, or can take an external examination to obtain their degree.

Direct contact in the group and individually are a self-evident fact for us. We have an open ear for students and parents, we give feedback and keep small talk... also outside of class. Because we want to be accessible. <br>The most important point is of course the class community. Sitting rigidly in front of the computer and listening to the teacher in no way corresponds to modern teaching. We let the students work with each other during and after class, but we also cater to their individual needs. <br><br> A student who likes group work can be fully involved in it. Students who prefer individual work will primarily receive this. These are the advantages of modern facilities. <br>Class leader lessons, class council and an intensive feedback structure are part of our methods to find a good community. Personal meetings are also planned from the beginning. We make sure that our students are doing well.</p>

Homework is also completed in this workbook so that the teacher can evaluate it immediately. Parents have access so that they can review the lesson content.

Additional analysis and support concepts for spelling and mathematics are planned. Cooperation for language certificates and additional qualifications is being sought. The vacation periods are based on the German vacations (teacher presence of colleagues working at other schools). For the summer vacations, 6 weeks are determined from the so-called core holiday density (the time when most of the German states have vacations).<br><br>The implementation of the KMK guidelines ensures the comparability of the requirements to German schools. Our goal is to ensure that our students can attend a German school at their age level and take German final examinations at any time. The level of performance is checked by regular performance assessments. At the end of a school year, grades are given out as an overview with feedback and learning recommendations.</p>

Our school is based on pioneering spirit and the desire to find new ways. This pioneering spirit is reflected in the high motivation and desire for good teaching. <br>At least once a year, a virtual parents' evening takes place, where parents can get information about the current school year and tips on how to support their children. In addition, a personal student feedback meeting with the school management is held with each student in each school year.<br></p>
